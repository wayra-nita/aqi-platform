04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Ann Arbor|MI|42.2754|-83.7308|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Therefore there will plenty of sunshine which will help the afternoon temperatures approach the century mark today. The well above normal temperatures and abundant sunshine will help ozone formation today. The ozone forecast for today will remain in the good AQI category, however there’s a decent chance that the northern portions of the County could reach the moderate AQI category today. Friday will feature less emissions and more high clouds during the first half of the day. Therefore the good AQI forecast for ozone will remain. A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown). Check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast. Forecaster – S. DiBiase|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Benton Harbor|MI|42.1167|-86.4542|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Temperatures will remain mild but cool somewhat along the coast with the return of onshore flow and possible fog.  Dry conditions will persist over the region through the period.  The atmosphere should remain generally well mixed leading to generally GOOD air quality for both PM2.5 and ozone.

Therefore there will plenty of sunshine which will help the afternoon temperatures approach the century mark today. The well above normal temperatures and abundant sunshine will help ozone formation today. The ozone forecast for today will remain in the good AQI category, however there’s a decent chance that the northern portions of the County could reach the moderate AQI category today. Friday will feature less emissions and more high clouds during the first half of the day. Therefore the good AQI forecast for ozone will remain. A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown).

The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown). Check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast. Forecaster – S. DiBiase|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Therefore there will plenty of sunshine which will help the afternoon temperatures approach the century mark today. The well above normal temperatures and abundant sunshine will help ozone formation today. The ozone forecast for today will remain in the good AQI category, however there’s a decent chance that the northern portions of the County could reach the moderate AQI category today. Friday will feature less emissions and more high clouds during the first half of the day. Therefore the good AQI forecast for ozone will remain. A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown).

Sunny skies, typical temperatures, and transport of precursors will help continue the production of ozone on Friday. Relative humidity will gradually increase throughout the day and help to create partly cloudy conditions, and in turn, slow the production to make for an overall similar scenario to Thursday, but with slightly higher concentrations of ozone into the late afternoon. Ozone readings may be threshold YELLOW in the Upstate and Midlands and CODE GREEN for all other zones.|South Carolina DHEC

In addition, partly cloudy skies will limit ozone formation.  As a result, AQI levels will be Good.    Friday, April 11:  As a weak cold front moves through central Ohio, mostly cloudy skies will reduce ozone formation.  However, light winds will reduce pollutant dispersion, and moisture associated with rain showers will enhance particle production.  These conditions will lead to Moderate AQI levels.    Saturday, a low-pressure system moving east through the Great Lakes will generate moderate south-southwesterly winds in central Ohio, transporting polluted air into the region.  In addition, mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s will enhance ozone production.  Therefore, AQI levels will remain Moderate.  Sunday, southerly winds will persist as a cold front approaches from the west, bringing additional pollutants into the Columbus region and keeping AQI levels Moderate.  Monday and Tuesday, as the cold front moves through central Ohio and departs to the east, winds will shift to westerly, dispersing pollutants and bringing cleaner air into the region.

Therefore there will plenty of sunshine which will help the afternoon temperatures approach the century mark today. The well above normal temperatures and abundant sunshine will help ozone formation today. The ozone forecast for today will remain in the good AQI category, however there’s a decent chance that the northern portions of the County could reach the moderate AQI category today. Friday will feature less emissions and more high clouds during the first half of the day. Therefore the good AQI forecast for ozone will remain. A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown).

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Detroit|MI|42.2330|-83.3330|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Eastern U.P.|MI|46.3456|-85.9453|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Flint|MI|43.0146|-83.6959|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Grand Rapids|MI|42.8330|-85.5170|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Revising today's air quality forecast from good to moderate for all regions of northern Indiana. Current fine particulate (PM2.5) readings are between 20 and 25 ug/m3 except for the South Bend and the Larwill PM2.5 monitors which are at 17 ug/m3. Expect good air quality for PM2.5 for Tuesday and Wednesday with an increase in PM2.5 concentrations by Thursday as the wind direction becomes southwesterly increasing both the PM2.5 concentrations and the temperature. A weak cold front will arrive by Friday changing the wind direction to a northwesterly direction improving the air quality, but without a strong push of colder air on Friday leaving the air quality forecast at moderate for Friday. The next air quality forecast update will be on Friday. Air quality forecast provided by IDEM, Office of Air Quality.|Indiana Dept. of Environmental Management

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Houghton Lake|MI|44.3147|-84.7647|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Tomorrow, a weak upper-level trough of low pressure will move through southern California, enhancing vertical mixing.  However, mostly sunny skies will continue to enhance ozone formation.  In addition, light winds during the morning and early afternoon will limit pollutant dispersion.  As a result, ozone levels will remain Moderate.|Imperial County Air Pollution Control District

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Kalamazoo|MI|42.2747|-85.5883|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Temperatures will remain mild but cool somewhat along the coast with the return of onshore flow and possible fog.  Dry conditions will persist over the region through the period.  The atmosphere should remain generally well mixed leading to generally GOOD air quality for both PM2.5 and ozone.

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Lansing|MI|42.7408|-84.5447|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

04/10/14|04/10/14||EDT|0|F|Y|Lehigh Valley|PA|40.6140|-75.5900|PM2.5|48|Good|No|Current Conditions: High pressure is moving off to our south and east this Thursday afternoon. The pressure gradient between this high and low pressure way up in Ontario has resulted in southwest winds increasing across the region, and warmer air advecting in. We will flirt with the 70 degree mark later on this afternoon, which would be the first time we have hit 70 in the daytime since early November of last year. After a few hours this morning of moderate air quality, increased mixing has caused concentrations to improve into the good range. Brisk winds will continue into this evening, then the wind will come down later on tonight. Towards morning, PM2.5 levels may increase, but only into the upper good zone.  ***  Friday's forecast: A slow moving cold front will affect the weather later Friday and Friday night with some rain. Lighter winds and increasing moisture may push PM levels to the moderate zone briefly during the midday hours, but rainfall late in the day and at night should keep overall averages for Friday in the upper good zone. Rain will move to the south and east of the region late Friday night.  ***  Extended forecast: Dry and warm weather will predominate over the upcoming weekend with a southwesterly flow. Fine particle concentrations should increase close to the moderate range Saturday, but then solidly into the moderate range by Sunday. Ozone levels might even rise to moderate criteria by Sunday with enough of the April sun and temperatures approaching 80 degrees in spots.

04/10/14|04/11/14||EDT|1|F|Y|Lehigh Valley|PA|40.6140|-75.5900|PM2.5|50|Good|No|Current Conditions: High pressure is moving off to our south and east this Thursday afternoon. The pressure gradient between this high and low pressure way up in Ontario has resulted in southwest winds increasing across the region, and warmer air advecting in. We will flirt with the 70 degree mark later on this afternoon, which would be the first time we have hit 70 in the daytime since early November of last year. After a few hours this morning of moderate air quality, increased mixing has caused concentrations to improve into the good range. Brisk winds will continue into this evening, then the wind will come down later on tonight. Towards morning, PM2.5 levels may increase, but only into the upper good zone.  ***  Friday's forecast: A slow moving cold front will affect the weather later Friday and Friday night with some rain. Lighter winds and increasing moisture may push PM levels to the moderate zone briefly during the midday hours, but rainfall late in the day and at night should keep overall averages for Friday in the upper good zone. Rain will move to the south and east of the region late Friday night.  ***  Extended forecast: Dry and warm weather will predominate over the upcoming weekend with a southwesterly flow. Fine particle concentrations should increase close to the moderate range Saturday, but then solidly into the moderate range by Sunday. Ozone levels might even rise to moderate criteria by Sunday with enough of the April sun and temperatures approaching 80 degrees in spots. Warm weather with moderate air quality will continue on Monday, but then a strong cold front brings rain Monday night into Tuesday with colder weather by the middle of next week.

Right now, strong southerly flow is contributing to the rise in temperatures, as readings range in the upper 60s.  Even though the temperatures are warming, air quality levels remain low thanks to the strong winds and the low dewpoint temperatures.  Expect conditions to remain within the good threshold as a frontal system approaches the region. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, mostly cloudy skies will persist over the region as a cool front drops southward toward our region.  This frontal system, which was over the Great Lakes region on Thursday, will provide a round of showers as it moves into our area.  Overall, temperatures will remain on the warm side, with highs peaking in the mid 60s.  Winds will be light as well.  Even with this conditions, the presence of the front and the persistent westerly flow (advecting in a cleaner air mass from the Ohio Valley) should help to keep PM 2.5 levels near the top of the good category. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect to see temperatures remain elevated early on as the frontal system, which pushed toward our region on Friday, jogs back to the north as a warm front over the weekend.  As a result, we should see our flow return out of the south, allowing temperatures to rebound closer to the 70 degree mark.  At the same time, a new storm system will begin to take shape over the Plains.  This system is expected to progressively move east early next week, with a likely impact on our area in the Monday / Tuesday time frame.  Once this cold front pushes in, expect more rain to develop over the region.  Once the cold front pushes through, return flow on the backside will be out of the north, allowing a cooler and drier air mass to build in.  Overall, air quality levels are expected to rise over the weekend as a result of temperatures and moisture levels increasing.  In fact, levels could peak as high as the moderate range for both PM2.5 and ozone.  However, this will be short-lived... the passage of the cold front on Tuesday will force air quality concentrations back down into the good range as a cleaner air mass filters in. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Ludington|MI|43.9553|-86.4525|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Temperatures will remain mild but cool somewhat along the coast with the return of onshore flow and possible fog.  Dry conditions will persist over the region through the period.  The atmosphere should remain generally well mixed leading to generally GOOD air quality for both PM2.5 and ozone.

There is a chance for rain in the evening and overnight associated with a wave of low pressure that will form along the frontal boundary.  Light winds and rising humidity will push particle concentrations into the Moderate range.    **Extended Forecast: Similar air quality conditions are expected on Saturday as the frontal boundary sags toward southern Delaware.  Rain may linger in the morning as the low pressure disturbance departs to the northeast.  Light winds, localized transport aloft, and ample atmospheric moisture will keep air quality in the Moderate range.  The frontal boundary will move north as a warm front on Sunday.  It will be a beautiful Spring day, with above average temperatures and mostly sunny skies.  Stagnation in the morning and rising humidity will allow air quality to persist in the Moderate range.  -Huff|Delaware Dept. of Natural Resources and Environment

As expected, we saw ozone concentrations go up around the forecast area under the light, west-to-east flow. The baseline for Thursday is higher, so it’s likely that levels will go higher as well under sunny skies and relatively light winds. An approaching upper-level system could boost levels further on Friday into the middle Moderate range before dropping off Saturday with increased surface breezes and atmospheric mixing.  PM10 levels also bounced higher, into the lower Moderate range on Wednesday. The South Phoenix and West 43rd Avenue monitors registered 53 and 55 AQI, respectively. Buckeye was not far behind at 50 AQI. This is a testament to how dry the soil has become, and long-range models suggest there will be no rain expected over the next 2 weeks. We don’t anticipate any significant blowing dust this weekend, but it’s possible to see some pockets along the desert floor between Phoenix and southern California Saturday into early Sunday.  Daytime temperatures are forecast to drop into the upper 80s, close to 90°F on Saturday and Sunday, warming slightly once again by Monday.

Daytime temperatures are forecast to drop into the upper 80s, close to 90°F on Saturday and Sunday, warming slightly once again by Monday. Check back on Friday for a closer look at the weekend's weather and air quality. Until then, have a good day! -J.Paul|Arizona Department of Environmental Quality

A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown).

04/10/14|04/10/14||EDT|0|F|Y|Pittsburgh|PA|40.4340|-79.9840|PM2.5|50|Good|No|Current Conditions: As of 2 PM on Thursday, mostly sunny skies prevail across the region as a ridge of high pressure extends up the East Coast.  Right now, strong southerly flow is contributing to the rise in temperatures, as readings range in the upper 60s.  Even though the temperatures are warming, air quality levels remain low thanks to the strong winds and the low dewpoint temperatures.  Expect conditions to remain within the good threshold as a frontal system approaches the region. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, mostly cloudy skies will persist over the region as a cool front drops southward toward our region.  This frontal system, which was over the Great Lakes region on Thursday, will provide a round of showers as it moves into our area.  Overall, temperatures will remain on the warm side, with highs peaking in the mid 60s.  Winds will be light as well.  Even with this conditions, the presence of the front and the persistent westerly flow (advecting in a cleaner air mass from the Ohio Valley) should help to keep PM 2.5 levels near the top of the good category. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect to see temperatures remain elevated early on as the frontal system, which pushed toward our region on Friday, jogs back to the north as a warm front over the weekend.  As a result, we should see our flow return out of the south, allowing temperatures to rebound closer to the 70 degree mark.  At the same time, a new storm system will begin to take shape over the Plains.  This system is expected to progressively move east early next week, with a likely impact on our area in the Monday / Tuesday time frame.  Once this cold front pushes in, expect more rain to develop over the region.  Once the cold front pushes through, return flow on the backside will be out of the north, allowing a cooler and drier air mass to build in.  Overall, air quality levels are expected to rise over the weekend as a result of temperatures and moisture levels increasing.  In fact, levels could peak as high as the moderate range for both PM2.5 and ozone.  However, this will be short-lived... the passage of the cold front on Tuesday will force air quality concentrations back down into the good range as a cleaner air mass filters in. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Overall, air quality levels are expected to rise over the weekend as a result of temperatures and moisture levels increasing.  In fact, levels could peak as high as the moderate range for both PM2.5 and ozone.  However, this will be short-lived... the passage of the cold front on Tuesday will force air quality concentrations back down into the good range as a cleaner air mass filters in. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Saginaw|MI|43.4196|-83.9495|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Temperatures will remain mild but cool somewhat along the coast with the return of onshore flow and possible fog.  Dry conditions will persist over the region through the period.  The atmosphere should remain generally well mixed leading to generally GOOD air quality for both PM2.5 and ozone.

04/10/14|04/10/14||MST|0|F|Y|San Tan Valley|AZ|33.2191|-111.5611|PM10|53|Moderate|No|Updated Thursday, April 10, 2014 at 11:15 a.m. The high clouds expected today are slower to arrive than originally anticipated and won’t arrive until later this evening. Therefore there will plenty of sunshine which will help the afternoon temperatures approach the century mark today. The well above normal temperatures and abundant sunshine will help ozone formation today. The ozone forecast for today will remain in the good AQI category, however there’s a decent chance that the northern portions of the County could reach the moderate AQI category today. Friday will feature less emissions and more high clouds during the first half of the day. Therefore the good AQI forecast for ozone will remain. A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown). Check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast. Forecaster – S. DiBiase|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Temperatures will remain mild but cool somewhat along the coast with the return of onshore flow and possible fog.  Dry conditions will persist over the region through the period.  The atmosphere should remain generally well mixed leading to generally GOOD air quality for both PM2.5 and ozone.  This includes inland valley such as the San Lorenzo Valley where the seasonal transition to milder temperatures and shorter nights helps residents reduce their use of wood burning stoves and fireplaces for home heating purposes.|Monterey Bay Unified APCD

There is a chance for rain in the evening and overnight associated with a wave of low pressure that will form along the frontal boundary.  Light winds and rising humidity will push particle concentrations into the Moderate range.    **Extended Forecast: Similar air quality conditions are expected on Saturday as the frontal boundary sags toward southern Delaware.  Rain may linger in the morning as the low pressure disturbance departs to the northeast.

04/10/14|04/10/14||MST|0|F|Y|Stanfield|AZ|32.8811|-111.9620|PM10|60|Moderate|No|Updated Thursday, April 10, 2014 at 11:15 a.m. The high clouds expected today are slower to arrive than originally anticipated and won’t arrive until later this evening. Therefore there will plenty of sunshine which will help the afternoon temperatures approach the century mark today. The well above normal temperatures and abundant sunshine will help ozone formation today. The ozone forecast for today will remain in the good AQI category, however there’s a decent chance that the northern portions of the County could reach the moderate AQI category today. Friday will feature less emissions and more high clouds during the first half of the day. Therefore the good AQI forecast for ozone will remain. A weak upper level low will move into the area this upcoming weekend and help temperatures drop back to more comfortable ranges and bring breezy conditions on Saturday. The PM10 levels will be slightly impacted on Saturday with most areas in the upper good to low moderate range on the AQI scale. The PM10 levels will drop on Sunday as the winds diminish and less dust causing activities will keep most areas in the good AQI category (excluding Stanfield and Cowtown). Check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast. Forecaster – S. DiBiase|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

04/10/14|04/10/14||EDT|0|F|Y|Susquehanna Valley|PA|39.9400|-76.6230|PM2.5|54|Moderate|No|Current Conditions: High pressure is moving off to our south and east this Thursday afternoon. The pressure gradient between this high and low pressure way up in Ontario has resulted in southwest winds increasing across the region, and warmer air advecting in. We will flirt with the 70 degree mark later on this afternoon, which would be the first time we have hit 70 in the daytime since early November of last year. After a few hours this morning of moderate air quality, increased mixing has caused concentrations to improve into the good range. Brisk winds will continue into this evening, then the wind will come down later on tonight. Towards morning, PM2.5 levels may increase, but only into the upper good zone.  ***  Friday's forecast: A slow moving cold front will affect the weather later Friday and Friday night with some rain. Lighter winds and increasing moisture may push PM levels to the moderate zone briefly during the midday hours, but rainfall late in the day and at night should keep overall averages for Friday in the good zone. Rain will move to the south and east of the region late Friday night.  ***  Extended forecast: Dry and warm weather will predominate over the upcoming weekend with a southwesterly flow. Fine particle concentrations should increase to the lower moderate range Saturday, and then solidly into the moderate range by Sunday. Ozone levels might even rise to moderate criteria by Sunday with enough of the April sun and temperatures approaching 80 degrees in spots. Warm weather with moderate air quality will continue on Monday, but then a strong cold front brings rain Monday night into Tuesday with colder weather by the middle of next week. A return to good air quality is likely Tuesday into Wednesday.--McAuliffe|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

04/07/14|04/10/14||EDT|3|F|Y|Traverse City|MI|44.7544|-85.6029|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY:  Monday, April 7th, 2014 through Monday, April 14th, 2014   Ozone: 8-hour concentrations are expected to be Good through the forecast period…  PM-2.5:  24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are expected to be Good to Low Moderate through the forecast period…   FORECAST DISCUSSION:  We will be looking at a couple of active weather systems during this forecast period.  As of Monday morning, we are tracking a low pressure system passing just to the south of Michigan.  Easterly winds will back around to northwest winds as this system passes by.  The backing winds will keep our Air Quality in the Good category.  The two active weather systems we will be tracking, this week, are expected to pass through the Midwest during Thursday night and again on Sunday.  Surface winds prior to each system will be brisk and from the southwest which could provide some minor creep in fine particulates.  The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

The brisk winds, however, should act to keep the atmosphere well mixed and generally in the Good to Low Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST:  Northwest winds, following the Sunday front, will provide cooler temperatures and clean Air Quality.

Temperatures will remain mild but cool somewhat along the coast with the return of onshore flow and possible fog.  Dry conditions will persist over the region through the period.  The atmosphere should remain generally well mixed leading to generally GOOD air quality for both PM2.5 and ozone.  This includes inland valley such as the San Lorenzo Valley where the seasonal transition to milder temperatures and shorter nights helps residents reduce their use of wood burning stoves and fireplaces for home heating purposes.|Monterey Bay Unified APCD
